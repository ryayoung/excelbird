One or more expressions could not be resolved.
As a reminder, expression strings should reference elements inside
square brackets with no quotes, like: {"[some_col] + [other_col]"} or {"[1] + 99"}.

The value inside the brackets must contain one of the following:
    - A valid index of an element in the parent container
    - The `id` of any element defined globally
    - The `header` of any Col or Row defined globally

Another possible cause of this error is when setting `isolate=True` to a Sheet.
When True, the sheet will resolve its own references immediately after creation
and then clear the global memory of references, meaning any element created before,
or inside, an isolated sheet cannot be referenced in an Expr by id or header
after that sheet was created.
