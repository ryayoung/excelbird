    "# Prerequisite Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "    This is an introduction to a couple intermediate Python concepts that are useful for excelbird.\n",
    "    **Skip this page if:** you already understand *object-oriented-programming*, *comprehensions*, and *iterable unpacking*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites (for this tutorial)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You understand basic types: *int*, *str*, *list*, *dict*, and know how to use and create them\n",
    "- You can write a function that takes *required* and *optional* arguments (i.e. `def func(required, optional=None): ...`) and know how to call that function.\n",
    "- You understand loops and how to iterate through things\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Argument** and **parameter**\n",
    "    - You'll see these terms a lot. They refer to the same thing, but indicate the perspective from which we're referring. For instance, function `def func(name): ...` has one *parameter*, `name`. When you call `func('Jeff')` you've given \"Jeff\" as an *argument* for `name`. Arguments are the things given, and parameters are taken/expeceted.\n",
    "- **Positional arguments** versus **keyword arguments**\n",
    "    - There are **only two** ways to pass an argument: By keyword, and by position. If we write, `func('Jeff')`, we've passed Jeff's name as a **positional argument** to *func*. If instead we write, `func(name='Jeff')`, we've given it a **keyword argument**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming things\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that some things are named in *snake_case* and others use *TitleCase*. This means something. *TitleCase* indicates the term is a **class** whose source code is written in Python. Pandas `DataFrame` is a Python class. Numpy's `ndarray` is written in C\n",
    "\n",
    "In excelbird, all layout element types are custom classes, **not** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "If asked to define what a \"car\" means, you may write:\n",
    "\n",
    "Car definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has wheels\n",
    "- Has colored paint\n",
    "- Moves forward\n",
    "\n",
    "You've just created a class. You defined a *type* of object. No car was created yet. You defined what attributes a car has, *and* how it should behave. Each time one is manufactured, you will have created an **instance** of Car, just like `1` is an instance of `int`, and `'hello'` is an instance of `str`."

    "### Magic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Excelbird objects can handle being used in arithmetic expressions, like `my_column * my_row / 5`. How is this possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object's magic methods have pre-defined names, and get called automatically by Python when a certain event happens. Square brackets: `my_list[5]` is just shorthand for `my_list.__getitem__(5)`. Python doesn't care what 'my_list' is - it will just call `__getitem__` when it sees the brackets. You can then customize that method however you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Math symbols work the same way: `\"py\" + \"thon\"` is just a shortcut for `\"py\".__add__(\"thon\")`. Define custom logic for `__add__`, and you can break math."
